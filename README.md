SAP Mobile Experience
## Description
Asset related to SAP's new Mobile Experience that we want to share with our partners and customers. To start with, we have included 4 sample export files of site defined in SAP Launchpad service with content (list of mobile apps) that can be used by mobile personas like project manager, finance manager etc. Customers/partners can use this as a reference to define themselves the content they want for their mobile personas. This content can be accessed using SAP Mobile Start app that went RTC on 31st Aug. The information is not a commitment, promise or legal obligation to deliver or maintain any material, code or functionality as the export files are just a sample for reference.
## Requirements
SAP Launchpad service is a pre-requisite.
## Download and Installation
The file can be imported using Site Manager. Within the "content manager" tab select "Import Content Items" button and upload the provided file.
