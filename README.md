# SAP Mobile Experience - Sample Export of Mobile Personas

## Description
Asset related to SAP's new Mobile Experience that we want to share with our partners and customers. We have included 4 sample export files from a site defined in SAP Launchpad service with content (list of apps) that can be used by mobile personas like project manager, finance manager etc. Customers/partners can use this as a reference to define themselves the content they want for their mobile personas. The information is not a commitment, promise or legal obligation to deliver or maintain any material, code or functionality as the export files are just a sample for reference.
## Requirements
SAP Launchpad service is a pre-requisite.
## Download and Installation
To use SAP Mobile Start you need to meet all the technical and content related pre-requisites. For the latest on how to perform these steps please see the SAP Mobile Start community page (https://community.sap.com/topics/mobile-applications).

"Mobile Personas" folder has 1 zip per mobile persona. Each zip file can be imported using Site Manager; within the "content manager" tab select "Import Content Items" button and upload the provided file.

## Known Issues
Note that this content was created manually in Site Manager (and not using content federation) so that it is easy to distibute the content. If you want to use the sample content by connecting to your own SAP S/4HANA backend system, you will need to change the system property within ALL the applications defined in this content.
